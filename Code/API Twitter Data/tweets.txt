@dblcapcrimpin Tsla goes to the moon when the non-cybertruck Fleet does well on FSD. Cybertruck has a lot of exposure but it having FSD that is less than perfect is relatively inconsequential to the stock.

@MyElectricAdv @GerberKawasaki @RJScaringe @Rivian Their Model Y competitor launches next year. For now they only compete with X / CT. But the data shows that most of their customers come from ICE vehicle such as range rover and jeep, so ICE is the main competition. TSLA and RIVN fans should be friends not enemies.

@Sandersmit83 @SawyerMerritt So what. If Elon puts a Tim Cook in charge to run the EV business responsibly, he can move his attention to xAI and do all the software development there. $TSLA may 10x again, but it won't 100x.

Despite not mentioning the @MorganStanley conflicts, how revenues / EPS increase, this note is actually pretty good. Shows EMH in the Muskonomy:

Elron stays = AI (and rainbows) = $310
Elron leaves = (dying) OEM = $50
50/50 = $180 spot?

@garyblack00 Gary claims he is bullish and long TSLA but drastically reduced the % held. And said in hindsight should have sold ALL of TSLA.

@thejefflutz @alex_avoigt You must be out of your mind.  TSLA gets the most amount of these payments and they allow TSLA to charge $7500 more per car. Also possibly another $3000 in USA battery incentives and powerwall incentives.  TSLA is fucked without IRA.

TSLA was down 3% at the time

Legit question, could be a dumb question. The same way $tsla could license FSD to other manufacturers, could $hood license their UI to other platforms like $sofi ?
Or is this not something that could happen?

@wintonARK $TSLA basically admitted they don‚Äôt retain the data and don‚Äôt train models on the data.  It was clear in their capex numbers they weren‚Äôt competing with the large tech/CSPs. The pivot to $10B spend on AI capex just shows how far behind they have become.

@williamjan93358 Actually, $UBER and $LYFT have diversified their services beyond basic ride-sharing, which might mitigate $TSLA's impact on their business model. They're adapting in ways that could surprise investors. @williamjan93358 thoughts?

@OnDaBus6am @WholeMarsBlog The momentum of shorts for $TSLA is coiling to go up, meaning, the price is going to go up. Naturally, lots of shorts will suffer. (Here I'm taking about weeks/months, not days)

Absolutely stupid.

$TSLA is down today because of the uncertainty from announced tariffs on EV parts and materials sourced from China from Joe Biden coming on Tuesday.

EPS has little-to-nothing to do with day-to-day price fluctuations. Only on Earnings Report days it matters. https://t.co/4VCgBYEs7h

China NEV (BEV+PHEV) monthly retail sales
3/n

If you believe seasonality and trend, the future of BEV and PHEV is still intact in China.

Weekly NEV adoption rate was already above 50% recently.

Affordability matters.

Trade-in incentive also helps.

@CornelyTristan I am still hoping LCID would built a 2/3 size

Their share price would surely be 100 times what they are now. 
I am biased - I have some.
Share price is all about VOLUME. It's not negotiable, 
just like TSLA.

Rolled these out to 180C 6/7 and collected an additional $30 credit. Right before the voting on 6/13. Will re-evaluate before then or perhaps I will even be able to close early if $TSLA goes lower before then.

@SBZung even market is solid green next few days, $TSLA wont move at all but atleast it get saved for that day.
everyday $TSLA is surrounded by -ve news.
hardly see +ve news and hard to see anything coming up.
shorts squeezed at $150 to $195 and bears are pulling it back.

@SBZung $TSLA dropped 20% in a week and everyday trimming of $3 avg.
May I know what do you see that it can go up all the way to $238. This requires multiple magics to happen. $TSLA cant move up without strong bulish news.
now under current situation $180 nearly impossible for May month.

In the largest auto/EV mkt one company is dominant in charging, which is a profitable biz already.

@fuegosaxy Because TSLA is overvalued.

As for GME, the stock has gone down for years, so money from selling calls is a smart strategy but still most people are down on their investment with where the stock is at.

Many bought during the January 2021 squeeze and still hold.

BEV trucks simply can‚Äôt compete against ice or hybrid pickups when towing is even a marginal requirement. 

By comparison this F150 will get roughly 600 miles on the hwy and 300 miles towing, versus ~100 miles for a $TSLA cyber truck!

With 36% gross margin, $BLNK will compete with $CHPT on Level 2 chargers and eat from their business. Blink model at 36% gross margin is much more sustainable than $CHPT at such a low gross margin.

@teslashanghai Buffett will never invest in $TSLA because there are no obvious economic moats.  It matches nothing he has ever invested in.

It's absurd anyone ever even entertained this thought or wasted a second of energy considering it.

Germany's outstanding political export services are Antifa and Frankfurt School, two violence-focused groups. 

Germany destroys itself, is second grade already in digitalisation, AI, a process, accelerated by the leftist mob.

3 down to the 50% Fib region here.

IF we are going to hold support as a (b) wave $TSLA should *at least* TRY for a solid bounce back toward 190-193 as a purple b of a wider/deeper flat.

Further weakness directly under 164 would get concerning. ‚ö†Ô∏è

BOD at TSLA oversaw one of the largest reductions in value in modern US Corp history.

@TeslaZuseHsnbrg @WallStXyz I think registration is already in place for TSLA to do ATM whenever it likes. 

Board vote is a formality; Musk could probably get it in under 1 hour if he really had to.

Decisions on how much $ to target and when to do the actual ATM are more real-world limiting factors.

The probability of $TSLA price going lower than 161.76 is not zero.

The next stop lower if 61.8% doesn't hold at 161.76 would be 76.4% at 153.01.

@MarkMcGrathCFP Sure, but you never use trailing to value companies that are growing at that place.  

And to be clear, TSLA is garbage, a meme that's insanely valued. AAPL is extremely overvalued, MSFT is richly valued.  NVDA at around 30x is below is 10 year average forward.

Forget Tesla's cars, even forget EVs, the value in TSLA stock is the driving software and data.  
When FSD is real, Tesla will dominate new EV sales but... Tesla can sell the nav to all the new cars in the world electric or gas, who cares. Software is the real value.

You've excluded that possibility from your life, because of your cultish loyalty to $TSLA. If you ever allowed yourself to suspect that maybe @Tesla's not that good, you'd *blame yourself*.

so will any margin that exists in the auto insurance industry, of which Geico &amp; Buffett dominate

@CuriousPejjy I respectfully decline making that prediction.

I'm forecasting $TSLA market cap based on when/if Tesla reaches certain milestones (Optimus, FSD, Energy).

Therefore, I have no more dates in my valuation.

Having said that, I'll add this:

Elon has to lay off another person and he‚Äôs narrowed the choice down to Robin or Jack.

Robin replies, ‚ÄúYou better jack off, I‚Äôve got a headache.

As a $TSLA investor, I'll be sorely disappointed w/less than 20% growth in 2024.   Tesla's has compelling products &amp; production capacity- they need to figure out how to sell more cars.

Here are 5 key takeaways from Day 1 of my Tesla $TSLA Discounted Cash Flow:

1) EV sales are slowing. Tesla's been running its Gigafactories at 80-90% of capacity for the past two years. I'm modeling for that to dip to 70-80% in 2024-2025.

2) Competition is increasing in China.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/IvJ7c3xxMK https://t.co/hvm4rnXclH https://t.co/a4XsbzKKbt

@DeltaNinety @Tesla Wrong take. It's the other way around. $TSLA needs to negotiate with $UBER to win over the users instead of letting them get taken by Waymo who already partners with Uber. AV/FSD fleets will compete against each other but they all will want to mass onboard customers thru Uber.

FrUD's Take:

"Elon Musk isolating himself at the top.

Both Zhu and Baglino were seen as potential replacements for CEO or even potential new COO to support Musk.

Now, one of them is not at Tesla anymore and the other is going back to China."

@Gfilche Mr Buffett. At 80 I have all my investment in TSLA so Elon can keep innovating at Tesla for a better future for all. Please do the same. It is a just cause. Besides America needs to be supportive of its own manufacturing industry. It will be patriotic.  Thanks in advance.

Question for @Tesla or $TSLA owners

How will FSD handle snow? 

I live in Maine with snow cover five months / year. My SUV‚Äôs sensors and cameras are always clogged / blocked during the winter.

How will FSD fare if a sensor or camera is blocked by the salt / sand / snow mixture?

$tsla investors are anchored at its top 400 a share and use it as a heuristic to think 180 is a bargain. 

But, Tesla earns 50 cents per share Q1. A 2 dollar EPS leads to 80 dollars a share, assuming 40PE.

How should Tesla handle the sales of Optimus?

Sell Optimus outright for $30,000 each. This would require optimizing for volume.
  
Lease Optimus via Robot as a Service (RAAS) for $10/hour. This model could potentially sell 95% fewer units for approximately the same profit.

@WholeMarsBlog Today, TSLA's stock price is $180 with a market cap of $580 billion. Elon holds 13% or $75 billion.

Buffett, with $200 billion, could buy into TSLA and own more shares than Elon if he wanted to.

However, without Elon, Tesla would lose its soul, and TSLA wouldn't be worth owning‚Ä¶ https://t.co/VLpBPgqwPg

$TSLA Many have said this before and I repeat. 
EVs have become commoditized. ex: Even countries like Vietnam (#vinfast) are able to produce them. Yes, not at tesla scale but players like #BYD are there already 
#FSD is an existential moment for Tesla. Without this valuation..

@tsla I strongly believe that holders of Tesla should all reinstate the 2018 pay package. Those that do not do so after what he did are not man of words. You (Ross Gerber &amp; Leo Koguan) are just men who marry a wife and file for a divorce after she bore you a son. Shame on you!

@TeslaAndDoge With Trump pretty much guarantee we lose $7500 federal credit plus $4000 battery manufacturing credit.  Powerwalls go up in price , cars go up in price for most consumers, so Tesla ASP goes down. Would be a huge hit to TSLA bottom line.

Just voted all my TSLA shares. Thank u James Stephenson! #ICannot_Enough  To Elon Musk and Tesla board of directors, I am concerned it was this hard to vote. Could there be a clandestine effort to co-op uncast shares for increased institutional voting power?
